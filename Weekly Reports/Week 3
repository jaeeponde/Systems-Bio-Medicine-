Activities Completed:
- Single Cell Genomics Training: Underwent training sessions with Sagarika to enhance my understanding of Single Cell Genomics, focusing on its methodologies and data analysis techniques.
- Presentation and Papers: Prepared presentations based on our learnings and discussed relevant research papers in the field of Single Cell Genomics.
- Deep understanding of a single protocol for isolation of DNA, RNA and protein simultaneously from the same sample.

Next Steps:
- We aim to further explore advanced concepts in Single Cell Genomics and possibly initiate discussions on potential project directions based on our newfound knowledge.
- Additionally, we will continue to collaborate with Sagarika and our professor to seek guidance and feedback on our progress.
