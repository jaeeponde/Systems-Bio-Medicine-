Activities Completed:
- Bioconductor Setup: Set up the Bioconductor environment and explored its functionalities and applications in genomic data analysis.
- WGCNA Understanding and Reports: Delved into the principles of Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).
- Used mamba forge to install bioconductor and it's required packages into a new environment. 

Next Steps:
- We aim to continue our exploration of WGCNA and possibly initiate practical implementations of this analysis technique in our projects.
- Additionally, we will ensure that our reports are comprehensive and well-documented to facilitate easy understanding and future reference.
