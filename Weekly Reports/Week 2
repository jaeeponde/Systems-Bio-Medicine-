Activities Completed:

- Single Cell RNA Seq Protocol: Focused on understanding the protocol for Single Cell RNA Sequencing, exploring its methodology and significance in biomedicine.
- Understanding Single Cell RNA Seq: We deepened our understanding of the principles and applications of Single Cell RNA Sequencing techniques.
- Understanding the role of PBMCs (Peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in single cell RNA sequencing and the protocol of itâ€™s isolation, storage, labeling etc. 

Next Steps:
- We plan to conduct further research and possibly explore practical implementations of Single Cell RNA Sequencing in upcoming weeks.
- Additionally, we will continue to discuss any queries or challenges encountered during our learning process.
